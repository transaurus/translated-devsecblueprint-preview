The DevSec Blueprint is a comprehensive, free, and open-source learning _guide_ designed to equip you with the essential skills and knowledge needed to transition into DevSecOps or grow within your DevSecOps career.

## What You'll Learn

By following The DevSec Blueprint, you'll gain:

- **Foundational Knowledge**: Understand the core principles of DevSecOps, Cybersecurity, and the Secure Software Development Life Cycle (SSDLC), and the importance of soft skills.
- **Core DevSecOps Skills**: Learn how to secure and automate infrastructure, build secure CI/CD pipelines, and implement robust monitoring systems through hands-on experience.
- **Hands-On Experience**: Apply your knowledge by completing [projects] that combines on-prem and cloud environments using your own homelab or cloud-lab setup.

## Getting Started

No matter where you are in your journey, The DevSec Blueprint has something for you. If you're ready to dive in, start with our [Prerequisities] page.

> **NOTE**: You do not have to finish this all in one go. Please, learn at your own pace and do what you feel is best for you. This is a very comprehensive plan that was put together by us, so it will take a lot of time to complete.

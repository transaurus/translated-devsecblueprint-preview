## Overview

This guide will help you create a Snyk account and generate the required token and organization ID for scanning purposes. If you're following along with the video, this document covers the steps that were not detailed due to time constraints.

## Account Creation Process

1. Navigate to the [Snyk Sign-Up Page](https://app.snyk.io/login).
2. Sign up using the **GitHub** option and follow the prompts to create your account.

   > **Note:** The sign-up process is straightforward and does not require a credit card initially.

3. Once registration is complete, you will be redirected to your Snyk dashboard:

## Obtaining Tokens and Organization ID

1. Click on your name at the bottom-left corner of the page and select **Account Settings**.
2. In the **General** section, locate the **Auth Token** field. Click **Generate** to create a token and make note of it. This token will be required later for integration.

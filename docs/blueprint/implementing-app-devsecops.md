## Introduction

I want you to always remember: A well-designed DevSecOps pipeline follows the Secure Software Development Life Cycle (SSDLC). Rather than treating security as a separate or final step (SDLC), a DevSecOps pipeline embeds security into every aspect of development, testing, and deployment.

In this section, I'll outline the critical stages a DevSecOps pipeline _should_ have, which will for just application deployment cases.

## Stages of a DevSecOps Pipeline

So, I've decided to use Jenkins compared to any other solution, because it's the one that I'm most familiar with. I personally think Jenkinsfile are easiest to read compared to GitLab Runners and GitHub/Gitea Actions files. Therefore, I highly advise you to go through this documentation how to write a Jenkinsfile: [Using A Jenkinsfile](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/jenkinsfile/)

Usually, a **Jenkins pipeline** for DevSecOps typically involves the a variety of stages to build, test, scan, and deploy your application. The outline listed below is sudo code, with an small explanation in each stage to follow:

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any

    stages {
        stage('Checkout Code') {
            steps {
                // Checking out code from Git repository (like GitHub, Gitea, GitLab, etc.)
                checkout scm
            }
        }

        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                // Example: Building the application
                // Could also include containerizing the application as well
            }
        }

        stage('Run Application Tests') {
            // Example: Running unit tests, acceptance tests, integration tests
            // It's usually best to do these in parallel to save time on builds :)
            parallel {
                stage('Unit Test'){
                    steps {
                    }
                }
                stage('Acceptance Test'){
                    steps {
                    }
                }
                stage('Integration Test'){
                    steps {
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        stage('Security Scanning') {
            parallel {
                stage('SAST Scanning'){
                    steps {
                        // This stage will run SAST Scanning tests against your code base.
                    }
                }
                stage('DAST Scanning'){
                    steps {
                        // This stage will run DAST scans against your running application.
                        // You'll want to ensure you run your app locally and run the solution against it.
                    }
                }
                stage('Container Scanning'){
                    steps {
                        // This stage would be dependant whether or not you're deploying
                        // a container to Kubernetes or Docker Swarm (or just plain old Docker).
                    }
                }
                stage('Dependency Scanning') {
                    steps {
                        // This stage will check your dependencies of you applicatino and
                        // log any vulnerabilities.
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                // Lastly, we will deploy your application. This could to any
                // environment you want.
            }
        }
    }

    post {
        always {
            // Example: Archiving reports and test results
            archiveArtifacts artifacts: '**/target/*.jar', allowEmptyArchive: true
            junit '**/target/test-*.xml'

            // Best practice - clean up the workspaces after it's all said an done.
            // Don't be that guy...
            cleanWs()
        }
    }
}
```

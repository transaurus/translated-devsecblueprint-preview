## Overview

Before diving into the core concepts and theories of DevSecOps, it's important to build a **solid foundation** with some essential background knowledge. The topics/concepts that I am going to recommend will be extremely beneficial for you to understand.. It'll also help you with going through the docs and understanding the flow as well.

## Concepts You'll Need To Know

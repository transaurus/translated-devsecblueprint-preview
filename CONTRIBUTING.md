### **3. Submitting Pull Requests**

When submitting a pull request:

1. Ensure that your code follows the existing style and guidelines in the repository.
2. Include a clear and concise **summary** of the changes you made, explaining why they are necessary or beneficial.
3. **Ensure the PR title follows the correct format**:  
   The title should be in the format:  
   `type(scope): summary`  
   Where:

   - **type**: The type of change (e.g., `build`, `fix`, `docs`, `ci`, `feat`)
   - **scope** (optional): A specific area or module affected (e.g., `projects`, `typo`, `workflow`, `blueprint`, `security`)
   - **summary**: A short description of the change (e.g., "add user login feature", "fix typo in README").

   Example titles:

   - `feat(projects): integrate new task management system`
   - `fix(typo): correct spelling mistake on home page`
   - `docs: update README with new instructions`

   **Note**: The PR title should be clear and provide context for the changes made. It should help the reviewer understand the scope and purpose of the change quickly.

4. Submit the pull request and also **post it in the `#dsb-contributors` channel** on [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/enMmUNq8jc). This helps the community stay informed about your changes, and allows our team to review and provide feedback.
